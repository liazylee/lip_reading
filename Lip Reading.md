#  Research Proposal: Lip Reading in English Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

## I. Title: Lip Reading in English Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

## II. Introduction:
This research project aims to develop a lip reading system for the English language by leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques. The primary objective is to enhance communication accessibility for the hearing impaired and explore applications in transcription, human-computer interaction, and security.

## III. Research Question:
How can machine learning and computer vision be used to accurately recognize and transcribe spoken English words from lip movements in real-time?

## IV. Objectives:

Create a comprehensive dataset of video recordings featuring English speakers for training and testing.
Develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing and transcribing spoken English words from lip movements.
Optimize the model's performance, accuracy, and real-time processing capabilities.
Evaluate the system's accuracy through extensive testing, including in real-world scenarios.
## V. Methodology:

The methodology for this research project consists of the following steps:

### A. Data Collection:
this section outlines the methods for collecting the necessary data for our research project.
To train and test our lip reading system, we will employ the following data collection approaches:

1. Recording Video Samples:

    * We will capture video samples of English speakers enunciating a wide range of words and phrases. These recordings will serve as the primary dataset for our research.
    * Each video will be annotated to provide ground truth transcriptions, aligning the spoken words with the corresponding lip movements.

2. Utilizing Existing Datasets:

   * To augment our dataset, we will consider leveraging publicly available resources. Specifically, we will explore the "Lip Reading Image Dataset" on [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apoorvwatsky/miraclvc1/data), which contains relevant images for lip reading research.
   

3. Extracting Data from Online Sources:

    * We will also consider downloading YouTube videos that feature English speakers and extracting both voice and subtitle information. From these videos, we will extract images of the speakers' faces and lips. To facilitate this, we may utilize the "YouTube Faces with Facial Keypoints" dataset on [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/youtube-faces-with-facial-keypoints).

### B. Model Development:

Create a deep learning model, potentially based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Train the model using the annotated dataset to recognize and transcribe spoken words.

1. Data Preprocessing:

    * We will extract images of the speakers' faces and lips from the video recordings.
    * We will also extract the corresponding audio data from the videos.
    * We will align the audio data with the images to create a dataset of images and corresponding audio files.
2. Dataset Splitting:

    * We will split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    * We will use the training set to train the model and the testing set to evaluate the model's performance.
3. Model Selection:

    * We will explore various deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).such as Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks.
    * We will select the model that yields the best performance on the testing set.
   

### C. Performance Optimization:

Fine-tune the model to improve recognition accuracy and reduce processing time.
Implement techniques to handle variations in lighting and background.
### D. Evaluation:

Assess the system's accuracy and real-time performance on a testing dataset.
Conduct real-world testing in different environments and with diverse speakers.
## VI. Timeline:

## VII. Expected Outcomes:
We anticipate that this research will result in a machine learning-based lip reading system capable of accurately transcribing spoken English words. This technology can significantly benefit the hearing impaired and improve speech recognition in various applications.
