## 1.1 Introduction

Lip-reading which also called Vision Speech Recognition (VSR) is the process of understanding speech by observing a
speaker's lip movements, without hearing the sound. Lip-reading is a challenging task because of the variability in the
lip movements of different speakers and the ambiguity in the lip movements of the same speaker. The variability in the
lip movements of different speakers is due to the differences in the shape and size of the lips, the speed of speech,
and the accent of the speaker. The ambiguity in
the lip movements of the same speaker is due to the fact that the same lip movement can correspond to different sounds,
and different lip movements can correspond to the same sound. Lip-reading is an important task because it can be used to
improve the performance of speech recognition systems in noisy environments, and to enable people with hearing
impairments to communicate more effectively.

Due to the development of deep neural networks and the availability of large datasets, lip-reading has evolved
from recognition of single alphabets to recognition of complete words and recently to recognition of complete
sentences,which is significantly improvement in the field of lip-reading.

Lip-reading can be typically followed by this framework:

1. frontend: extract visual features from the input video.
2. backend: classify the visual features into words.

For an automated lip-reading system, the process are illustrated in Figure 1.1.
