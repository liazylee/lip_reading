# Concept for Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction
This is an introduction of technical terms in deep learning, which helps to build an
instinctive understanding of deep learning. we are not going to dive into the mathematical details or 
the implementation of the algorithms. Instead, we will focus on the intuition behind the concepts.
To help you understand the technical terms,what they mean, and how they are used in deep learning.

we will follow the historical development of deep learning, starting from the basic concepts and gradually
moving to more advanced concepts, As the de
